<h2>What To Expect</h2>


<p>Metro is a very diverse community with over 65 percent minority enrollment. This lets students get more comfortatble with people around them and differing backrounds and curlutal roots then their own. I personally have found this diversity to be refershing in a commonly devided and conflictive world, many of my peers share this same experience.</p>

 <h2>Downsides</h2>


 <p>Metro, although being very diverse and having many great benfits to set you up well for the future, has its downsides. Metro is a very rigorious school and this can often put much stress on the student for high expecations as it takes a 90% for students to pass a class. As well some students still feel unrepresented as metro has yet to fully incorprete and emprace how diverese and special of a school it is.</p>
